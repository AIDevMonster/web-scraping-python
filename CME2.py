#previously i said scraping CME is soooo effortless
#i guess CME has found out what i said
#now they totally changed the website from xml structure to json query
#i used inspect element to see where json files are stored
#so i only need to remember the code for each commodity
#the most reliable way would be scrape the website first
#use regular expression to find the json query 
#then scrape the json file
