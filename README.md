# Web-scraping

This folder contains some python web scrapers. I mainly use them to scrape the price on different future exchanges around the world. The key thing for scraping is to understand the html parse tree of the website and doing ETL. So far the most efficient way of ETL I found is regular expression. It is much more powerful than beautiful soup. OF course, regular expression is a pain in the ass. 

I used to scrape a lot of websites, including Shanghai Metals Market, London Metal Exchange, but there is not too much technique to do those. I only keep these three as they are three classic webscraping.

1. Chicago Merchantile Exchange CME

2. Shanghai Future Exchange SHFE

3. Shanghai Gold Exchange SGE

# Updates

Previously I had said scraping CME was effortless. It freaking backfired. CME websites changed its website structure from XML to JSON query. So I had to update the new method to scrape CME which is called CME2.
